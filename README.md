## 📘 Project Overview

Passwords are often the first line of defense in securing personal and sensitive information. This project provides a machine learning-based predictive model that categorizes passwords into different strength levels (Weak, Normal, Strong), helping users understand and improve their password security.

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of passwords and uses various machine learning algorithms to classify new password inputs based on learned patterns.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Predictive Analysis**: Classifies passwords as **Weak**, **Normal**, or **Strong**.
- ⚙️ **Customizable Pipeline**: Easily retrain the model using your own datasets.
- ⚡ **Real-time Prediction**: Quickly evaluates password strength based on multiple criteria.
