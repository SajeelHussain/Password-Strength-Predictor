## Project Overview
Passwords are often the first line of defense in securing personal and sensitive information. This project provides a predictive model that categorizes passwords into different strength levels, helping users understand and improve their password security.

The model is trained on a dataset of passwords labeled by strength, utilizing machine learning algorithms to classify new inputs based on similar patterns. 

## Features
- **Predictive Analysis:** Determines the strength of passwords as `Weak`, `Normal`, or `Strong`.
- **Customizable Model:** The project includes data preprocessing and model training scripts to allow customization and retraining.
- **Real-time Prediction:** Quickly assesses password strength based on various input characteristics.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following folders:
- **Data:** Contains datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **Model:** Contains the machine learning model files, including training scripts and saved models.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SajeelHussain/Password-Strength-Predictor.git
   cd Password-Strength-Predictor

## Usage
1.Training the Model:

Add your dataset to the Data folder if using custom data.
Run the training script from the Model directory:



Copy code
 ```bash
python Model/Password_Strength_Predictor.py
 ```
## Predicting Password Strength:
To test the strength of a password, use the prediction script in the Model directory:

   

Copy code

 ``` bash

python Model/Password_Strength_Predictor.py --password "YourPasswordHere"

   ```


## Evaluation:

The model can be evaluated with test data from the Data folder. Modify the data files as necessary for customized evaluation.
## Technologies Used
